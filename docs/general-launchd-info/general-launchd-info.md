## Correct way to remove a launchd job:

```bash
# 1. First, unload the job
launchctl unload ~/Library/LaunchAgents/com.kdm.journal-automation.plist

# 2. Then delete the plist file
rm ~/Library/LaunchAgents/com.kdm.journal-automation.plist
```

## Why this order matters:

- **Unloading first** tells launchd to stop monitoring the job and remove it from its internal registry
- **Just deleting the file** leaves the job loaded in launchd's memory, which can cause:
  - The job to continue running on schedule even though the file is gone
  - Confusing behavior where `launchctl list` still shows the job
  - Potential issues if you try to recreate the job later

## Verification:

After unloading, verify it's gone:

```bash
launchctl list | grep journal
```

You should see no output if it was successfully removed.

## If you already deleted the file without unloading:

If you've already deleted the plist file but the job is still loaded, you can still unload it by name:

```bash
launchctl unload com.kdm.journal-automation
```

or force remove it:

```bash
launchctl remove com.kdm.journal-automation
```

This is similar to how you'd stop a service before uninstalling it in other systems - always clean up the running process before removing the configuration.

# Claude

You should **unload and reload** the plist file after making changes. Simply editing the file won't update the running configuration in launchd.

## Proper way to update a launchd job:

```bash
# 1. Unload the current job
launchctl unload ~/Library/LaunchAgents/com.kdm.journal-automation.plist

# 2. Make your changes to the plist file
# (edit the file with your new script name/path)

# 3. Reload the job with the new configuration
launchctl load ~/Library/LaunchAgents/com.kdm.journal-automation.plist
```

## Why this is necessary:

When launchd loads a plist file, it reads the configuration into memory. After that:

- **launchd doesn't monitor the plist file for changes**
- **Editing the file doesn't affect the running job**
- The job continues using the original configuration until you explicitly reload it

## Verification:

After reloading, you can verify the changes took effect:

```bash
# Check that it's loaded
launchctl list | grep journal

# For more detailed info about the job configuration
launchctl print gui/$(id -u)/com.kdm.journal-automation
```

## Alternative approach:

You can also combine the unload/load steps:

```bash
# Unload and immediately reload in one command
launchctl unload ~/Library/LaunchAgents/com.kdm.journal-automation.plist && \
launchctl load ~/Library/LaunchAgents/com.kdm.journal-automation.plist
```

This pattern (unload → modify → reload) is the standard practice for updating any launchd configuration, whether you're changing script paths, schedules, environment variables, or any other settings.
