> I'll help you set up your journal automation to run both automatically via launchd on macOS and manually when needed. Let's create a complete solution.

## Setting up for both automatic and manual execution

### Step 1: Fix the module import issue

First, let's make sure your script can run manually from anywhere. Create a small shell script wrapper that handles the path issues:

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# Set up environment for launchd
export PATH="/usr/local/bin:/usr/bin:/bin:/usr/sbin:/sbin:/opt/homebrew/bin"

# Path to the automation directory
AUTOMATION_DIR="/Users/kdm/projects/digital-ext/business-os-automations"
JOURNAL_ROOT="/Users/kdm/projects/digital-ext/business-os/00_daily-journal"

# Log the start
echo "$(date): Starting journal
```

### Step 2: Create a launchd plist file for scheduling

Now, let's create a launchd plist file to run your script daily at 1:00 AM:

```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<!DOCTYPE plist PUBLIC "-//Apple//DTD PLIST 1.0//EN" "http://www.apple.com/DTDs/PropertyList-1.0.dtd">
<plist version="1.0">
<dict>
    <key>Label</key>
    <string>com.kdm.journal-automation</string>

    <key>Program</key>
    <string>/Users/kdm/projects/digital-ext/business-os-automations/bin/run_journal_daily_setup.sh</string>


    <key>StartCalendarInterval</key>
    <dict>
        <key>Hour</key>
        <integer>1</integer>
        <key>Minute</key>
        <integer>0</integer>
    </dict>

    <key>StandardOutPath</key>
    <string>/Users/kdm/Library/Logs/journal_daily_setup.log</string>

    <key>StandardErrorPath</key>
    <string>/Users/kdm/Library/Logs/journal_daily_setup.err</string>

    <key>EnvironmentVariables</key>
    <dict>
        <key>PATH</key>
        <string>/usr/local/bin:/usr/bin:/bin:/usr/sbin:/sbin</string>
    </dict>
</dict>
</plist>
```

### Step 3: Installation and setup instructions

## Additional PocketFlow Insights

Looking at your journal automation code, I can provide more context about PocketFlow for your learning journey:

PocketFlow is a Python workflow automation framework that uses a node-based approach. Here's what makes it special:

1. **Node-Based Architecture**: Each task is encapsulated in a `Node` class with a clear lifecycle:

   - `prep`: Prepares data and context before execution
   - `exec`: Performs the main task
   - `post`: Handles cleanup and passes data to the next node

2. **Declarative Flow Definition**: The `>>` operator creates a clean, readable way to define workflow sequences:

   ```python
   archive >> create_folder >> create_file
   ```

3. **State Management**: The `shared` dictionary is passed between nodes, allowing them to share context.

4. **Error Handling**: Each node can handle its own errors and determine the next step.

For your journal automation, the flow works like this:

1. `ArchiveOldFolders` moves previous journal entries to an archive structure
2. `CreateTodayFolder` creates today's folder with the date format
3. `CreateJournalFile` generates a markdown template file in the new folder

This is a great use case for PocketFlowâ€”it breaks down a process into discrete steps that can be tested, maintained, and extended independently.

If you want to expand this automation in the future, you could add nodes for:

- Backing up journal entries to cloud storage
- Generating analytics on your journaling habits
- Creating weekly/monthly summary files
